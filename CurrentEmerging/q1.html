                    <h4>Understanding Additive Manufacturing used by 3D Printing</h4>
                    <p>3D printing, or additive manufacturing, creates objects layer by layer from digital models. Unlike subtractive methods that carve away excess material, additive processes use only what is needed, significantly reducing waste (3Dnatives, 2024).</p>

                    <h4>Reducing Waste and Energy Use</h4>
                    <p>Traditional manufacturing methods, such as CNC machining and injection molding, can waste up to 70% of raw materials due to subtractive processes and overproduction.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, 3D printing reduces production scrap by up to 90%, using only the material necessary to build an object layer by layer (Raise3D, 2024).</p>
                    <p>Advanced techniques like hollow infill structures allow printed parts to maintain performance. Factory energy efficiency also improves, as additive manufacturing requires less power and eliminates the need for carbon-heavy supply chains and extensive transportation logistics.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Localized and On-Demand Production</h4>
                    <p>3D printing enables decentralized production, reducing the need for global transportation and packaging. This lowers emissions and supports local economies (3DNatives, 2024).</p>
                    <p>On-demand manufacturing prevents overproduction and excess inventory, allowing businesses to produce only what is needed.</p>
                    </section>

                    <h4>Eco-Friendly Materials</h4>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p><strong>PLA (Polylactic Acid):</strong> A biodegradable thermoplastic made from renewable resources like corn and sugarcane. It is compostable and widely used in consumer-grade 3D printing.</p>
                        <p><strong>ABS:</strong> A durable petrochemical-based plastic. While not biodegradable, it is recyclable and commonly used in industrial applications.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p><strong>Bio-composites:</strong> Filaments infused with natural fibers like wood, hemp, or algae. These reduce plastic content and add aesthetic or structural benefits.</p>
                        <p><strong>Recycled PET & Nylon:</strong> These materials are increasingly used in professional 3D printing, offering strength and sustainability by repurposing waste plastics (Sinterit, n.d.).</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    
                    <h4>Long-Term Sustainability Potential</h4>
                    <p>According to the European Commission, 3D printing could save up to 90% of raw materials by 2050, reducing emissions from extraction and processing (Sustainly, 2023). This positions additive manufacturing as a transformative force in industries like construction, fashion, and healthcare.</p>
                    

                    
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>3D printing offers a compelling path toward sustainable manufacturing. By minimizing waste, enabling local production, and embracing eco-friendly materials, it reshapes how we think about environmental responsibility in industry.</p>
