                    <h4>The Medical Industry</h4>
                    <p>
                        3D printing has become quite a game changer in the medical industry, with a wide variety of applications in the space.

                                3D printers can make exact-fit dental implants using CT scans of the patient and CAD modelling. This can greatly improve 
                                comfort for the patient as well as give better functionality. <br>(Raise3D, 2024)

                                Similarly to dental implants, prosthetics can be greatly improved through 3d printing by taking precise measurements of the patient
                                and using CAD models to quickly produce precise fitting proesthic limbs. It also allows for greater patient customization due to how easy
                                it is to make changes to the prosthetic through this method. <br>(Naoum, 2025)

                                3D printing allows for quite the improvement in surgery preparedness by allowing surgeons and research teams to use diagnostic imaging data 
                                to recreate a patients organs in 3D printed form. This allows the surgeons to develop better strategies pre-op, creating safer, more efficient, 
                                and more accurate procudures. <br>(Raise3D, 2024)

                    <p>
                        When it comes to aerospace and defense, 3D printing has allowing for impressive weight reduction of many different parts, as well as 
                        significant reductions of production costs.

                                Across the board 3D printing has allowed for significant weight reduction, a critical factor in aircraft and spacecraft design.
                                It also reduces production costs, part lead times, and waste. <br>(Raise3D, 2024)

                                Aircraft from many companies these days, particularily Airbus, have thousands of 3D printed components in them. These parts vary from simple 
                                cabin components, all the way to critical engine components. <br>(Raise3D, 2024)

                                Rocket payloads can cost well upwards of $10,000 per pound of weight (Ward, 2024). This means that saving every single possible gram is 
                                of critical importance. 3D printing allows for the fast creation of extremely lightweight components made of a variety of materials, saving pounds, 
                                and therefore potentially tens of thousands of dollars per launch. <br>(Raise3D, 2024)

                    <h4>Personal Use</h4>
                    <p>
                        3D printing has seen massive use by individuals for DIY, hobbies, and personal projects. It makes it much easier for people with less hands-on manufacturing 
                        experience to produce their own items quickly and for very little cost. These can be parts for devices, decorations, toys, paperweights, art pieces, or just about 
                        anything you can think of. 3D printers range in price from only a few hundred dollars up to many thousands of dollars, so the cost of entry isn't high 
                        for a lower-end printer. This makes it possible for it to be far cheaper and easier than making these things using expensive power tools and materials.
