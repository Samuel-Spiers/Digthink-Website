This is a series of 3 websites made during our Semester 2 Digital Thinking class. This series of projects was completed with a team of 3 students. Samuel Spiers, Matthew Stephen, and Zaki Nouri.
The goal of these projects was to demonstrate our ability to work in a team environment and collaborate through a GitHub repository, while practicing our Bootstrap CSS skills.
