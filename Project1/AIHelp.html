            <h2 class="mt-4">Changing How Coding Is Taught <span class="source">(Caballar, 2024)</span></h2>

            <p>Computer science students are rapidly adopting AI technologies, using them to better understand complex programming concepts, summarize research papers, brainstorm solutions, and even to learn how to code. </p>
            <blockquote>
                “Students are early adopters and have been actively testing these tools.” - Johnny Chang, TA at Stanford University
            </blockquote>
            <p>Educators are also adapting by exploring how to integrate AI into their teaching without compromising the foundational aspects of computer science education. They aim to find a balance between leveraging AI tools and ensuring students still learn essential skills like logic and problem-solving.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Less Emphasis on Syntax, More on Problem Solving <span class="source">(Caballar, 2024)</span></h2>

            <p>As AI tools become more sophisticated, the focus of computer science instruction is beginning to shift. While introductory courses continue to teach syntax and how to write and read code, there is growing emphasis on teaching students how to test and debug their programs. Educators recognize the importance of students being able to analyze and verify AI-generated outputs by breaking down complex problems into manageable components.</p>
            <blockquote>
                “Given that large language models are evolving rapidly, we are still learning how to do this.” - Ooi Wei Tsang, National University of Singapore
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                “AI tools will free up time for us to teach higher-level thinking.” - Ooi Wei Tsang
            </blockquote>
            <p>With AI assisting in code generation and basic logic, educators are now able to dedicate more instructional time to advanced topics such as system optimization, the ethical implications of computing, and the importance of designing user-friendly systems.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Avoiding AI's Coding Pitfalls <span class="source">(Caballar, 2024)</span></h2>

            <p>While AI copilots offer numerous advantages, they also come with potential drawbacks. Students must be taught to critically evaluate AI outputs rather than accept them blindly. Relying too heavily on AI can disrupt the learning process and diminish students' understanding. Therefore, AI should serve as a supportive tool rather than an autopilot that takes control.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Supporting Young Learners <span class="source">(Hewitt, 2024)</span></h2>

            <p>Research suggests that AI code generators can also make programming more accessible to younger students. These tools can provide valuable support in learning languages like Python and html, helping students to understand and create code while maintaining their ability to modify and test it independently. Students who used AI-assisted tools achieved positive learning outcomes and were still able to manually refine their code. However, it's essential that these learners remain actively engaged. The best educational outcomes occur when students use AI outputs as a foundation, taking the initiative to verify, question, and enhance the suggestions provided by the technology.</p>
