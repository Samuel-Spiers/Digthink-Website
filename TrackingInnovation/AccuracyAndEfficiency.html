        <p>
            AI uses deep learning, similar to convolutional neural networks, to rebuild a clear and detailed MRI image even when a scan collects less data that usual. This means MRI scans can be done 50-70% faster with losing image quality. The images often look sharper and have less noise or distortion. <br><br>
            AI systems trained on large sets of MRI scans can spot small or early signs of problems such as tumors, lesions, or brain diseases. They are often just as accurate or even better than doctors at catching these issues.<br><br>
            AI tools help manage medical scans by sorting the most urgent scans first by highlighting anything unusual and marking important areas, and even starting the report for the doctor. This saves time and better aids doctors with meeting with and accessing clients.<br><br>
            AI can create images that look like they were taken with dye, even when no dye is used. This could cut down the need for contrast by up to 90%, which is especially helpful for patients with kidney issues or those who need frequent scans.<br><br>
            AI can spot early warning signs of diseases like alzheimer's and other certain cancers by studying patterns or changes in the body's structure or metabolism, often before any symptoms show up.
