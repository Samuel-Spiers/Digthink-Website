            <p>
                Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines are advanced medical devices tha tuse powerful magnets, radio waves, and cumputer technology to create detailed images of the inside of a human body. Unllike X-rays or CT scans, MRIs <strong>do not use radiation</strong>. They are especially useful for visualizing sot tissues such as the brain, spinal cord, muscles, and organs, helping doctors diagnose conditions like tumors, strokes, joint injuries, and more.

            <!-- Who created it? What individuals and organizations were involved? -->
            <h4 class="m-2">Creators</h4>

            <p>
                MRI technology was developed through the contributions of several scientists and institutions:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dr Raymond Damadian</strong>: Proposed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to detect cancerous tissue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Paul Lauterbur</strong>: Created the first MRI images using magnetic field gradients.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Peter Mansfield</strong>: Developed fast imaging techniques that made MRI practical for clinical use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Organizations like <strong>Oxford Instruments, GE</strong>, and <strong>FONAR Corporation</strong> helped commercialize MRI machines in the 1980's
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Where and When</strong>: The first MRI images were produced in the early 1970's. The first full body MRI scan of a human was completed in 1977 in New York. The first commercial MRI machine was released in 1980.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Development Milestones</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            1940s: Discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            1971: Damadian showed NMR could distinguish cancerous tissue.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            1973: Lauterbur published the first MRI image.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            1980s: MRI machines entered hospitals and became widely used.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Why It Was Created</strong>: MRI was developed to provide a non-invasive, radiation-free way to visualize the human body. It solved the limitations of earlier imaging methods and allowed for earlier, more accurate diagnoses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Impact</strong>: MRI Revolutionized medicine by improving detection of diseases, guiding treatment plans, and enabling research into brain function, heart health, and more. It changed how doctors explore the human body and how patients experience diagnostics.
                </li>
            </ul>
