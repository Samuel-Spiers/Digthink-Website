        <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) emerged from decades of scientific breakthroughs in physics, chemistry, and medicine. Here's a deeper look at the pivotal moments and people who shaped its development.</p>

        <h4 class="p-2">The Foundation: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</h4>

        <p>
            In 1938, Isidor Isaac Rabi first observed nuclear magnetic resonance using molecular beams in a vacuum. His technique allowed precise measurement of nuclear magnetic moments and earned him the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physics <br><br>
            Rabi’s work laid the groundwork for future applications, but it was limited to isolated nuclei in non-biological settings
        </p>

        <h4 class="p-2">From Physics to Biology: Bloch and Purcell's Breakthrough</h4>

        <p>
            In 1946, Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell independently demonstrated NMR in condensed matter—Bloch with water, Purcell with paraffin wax<br>
            Their work showed that water molecules in tissues respond differently to magnetic fields, enabling contrast between tissue types.<br>
            They were jointly awarded the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physics for developing methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements.
        </p>

        <h4 class="p-2">Early Biomedical Applications: Odeblad and Lindstr&ouml;m</h4>

        <p>
            In 1955, Erik Odeblad and Gunnar Lindström published pioneering research showing that different tissues have distinct relaxation times, likely due to water content and lipid binding.<br>
            Odeblad adapted an early spectrometer to study biological samples, laying the foundation for MRI contrast mechanisms.
        </p>

        <h4 class="p-2">Damadian's Vision: Cancer Detction with NMR</h4>

        <p>
            In 1971, Dr Raymond Damadian published a paper in <emphasis>Science</emphasis> showing that cancerous tissue has longer relaxation times than healthy tissue.<br>
            He hypothesized that NMR could be used to non-invasively detect cancer, and filed the first patent for a body scanner in 1972, approved in 1974.<br>
            On July 3, 1977, Damadian and his team produced the first full body MRI scan using a machine called <em>Indomitable</em>.
