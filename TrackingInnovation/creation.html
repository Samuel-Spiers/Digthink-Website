        <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) emerged from decades of scientific breakthroughs in physics, chemistry, and medicine. Here is a deeper look into some of the primary moments and people who shaped its development.</p>

        <h4 class="p-2">The Foundation: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</h4>

        <p>
            In 1938, Isidor Isaac Rabi first observed nuclear magnetic resonance using molecular beams in a vacuum. His technique allowed an increased precision when taking measurements of nuclear magnetic moments, and earned him the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physics.<br><br>
            Rabi's work laid the groundwork for future applications, but it was limited to isolated nuclei in non-biological settings

            <h4 class="p-2">From Physics to Biology: Bloch and Purcell's Breakthrough</h4>

            <p>
                In 1946, Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell independently demonstrated NMR in condensed matter. For this, Bloch used water and Purcell used paraffin wax<br>
                Their work showed that water molecules in tissues respond differently to magnetic fields, concluding that a difference could be determined between different tissue types.<br>
                They were jointly awarded the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physics for developing methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements.

        <p>
            Pioneering research, published in 1955 by Erik Odeblad and Gunnar Lindstr&ouml;m, showcases different tissues have distinct relaxation times, likely due to water content and lipid binding.<br>
            Odeblad adapted an early spectrometer to study biological samples which layed the foundation for MRI contrast mechanisms.

        <h4 class="p-2">Damadian's Vision: Cancer Detction with NMR</h4>

        <p>
            In 1971, Dr Raymond Damadian published a paper in <emphasis>Science</emphasis> showing that cancerous tissue has longer relaxation times than healthy tissue.<br>
            He hypothesized that NMR could be used to non-invasively detect cancer, and filed the first patent for a body scanner in 1972, approved in 1974.<br>
            On July 3, 1977, Damadian and his team produced the first full body MRI scan using a machine called <em>Indomitable</em>.
